st.write("""The output of the code is a count plot (a bar chart) that shows the distribution of tracks across different decades in your dataset.

Why the counts decrease after some decades

There are a few possible reasons:

1. Dataset bias (most common)
The dataset (e.g., Spotify dataset) might contain more recent music and fewer old tracks. Streaming platforms usually prioritize modern music catalogs, so counts in early decades (1950s, 1960s) are often underrepresented.

2. Music industry changes
* Earlier decades (e.g., 1960sâ€“1980s) had fewer global releases, physical limitations (vinyl, cassettes), and lower documentation.
* In the 2000sâ€“2010s, the digital era allowed a huge surge in music production, so counts peak.
* In the 2020s (if included), the data may look smaller simply because the decade isnâ€™t finished yet.

3. Data truncation
* Some datasets stop at a certain year (e.g., up to 2019), so the last decade might look incomplete.

4. Genre and popularity shifts
* Certain decades had more popular music production (e.g., 1980s pop, 1990s rock), while others had less mainstream output.

1. Acousticness
* High in earlier decades (folk, jazz, rock with acoustic instruments).
* Decreases with the rise of electronic & synthesized music in 1980sâ€“2000s.
* May rise again in 2010s due to indie/folk revival

2. Danceability
* Lower in old ballads/rock.
* Rises in disco era (1970s), EDM/hip-hop (1990sâ€“2010s)
* Fluctuates depending on popularity of dance-oriented genres

3. Energy
* Rises with rock, punk, EDM (1980sâ€“2010s).
* May drop in 2010sâ€“2020s when lo-fi, mellow hip-hop, and chill pop became trendy.

4. Instrumentalness
* High when instrumental genres (jazz, classical crossovers, progressive rock) were more popular.
* Drops in modern decades since vocals dominate mainstream music.

5. Liveness
* Spikes in decades with live-recording styles (1970s rock concerts, MTV Unplugged in 1990s).
* Lower in studio-polished music (2000sâ€“2010s).

6. Valence (positiveness/happiness)
* High in disco/pop eras (1970sâ€“1980s).
* Drops during grunge/alternative rock era (1990s)
* Mixed trends in 2010s with both upbeat EDM and darker hip-hop/lo-fi.
